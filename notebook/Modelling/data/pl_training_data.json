        "Job Description Senior Data Scientist Hi all, we have partnered up with yet another unicorn status organization, yes unicorns popping up left right up down these days.  Who are they? Glad you ask! They are definitely not the leading tech organization that needs no introduction. In fact, their marketing is horrendous if you ask me.  Do they have enough data? How much is enough?  How\u2019s the culture and working environment? It\u2019s a start-up, you know what they say about start-ups, they are fast paced but with strong family-knit culture. This one is well, different, you gotta be ready to be thrown into a massive data jungle with little structure, think of this as LEGO playing ground with LEGO pieces scattered everywhere.  What is the role exactly? Selling complex solutions with cool buzz words to stakeholders\u2026is not what you\u2019ll be doing. Different projects, pretty dynamic, there\u2019s computer vision project, image recognition, business analytics optimization, market analytics (segmentation), churn model, and I can\u2019t remember the rest, but ya a lot.  Requirements ser? The usual, Python or R, being good with machine learning models, and able to bridge data to business. Oh another one, hiring manager is rather anal on years of experience, so a minimum of 3 years of experience as data scientist, not just carrying the title \u2018Data Scientist\u2019 but doing data engineering or data visualization alone, that won\u2019t cut it, I tried \u2639 Additional Information Career Level Senior Executive Qualification Bachelor's Degree, Post Graduate Diploma, Professional Degree Years of Experience 3 years Job Type Full-Time Job Specializations Computer/Information Technology, IT-Software",
